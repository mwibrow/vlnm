VLNM: vowel normalization and plotting using Python
===================================================

:Release: |release|
:Date:    |today|

What is VLNM?
-------------

|vlnm| is a |python| package, primarily aimed at phoneticians
who need to normalize vowel data
(i.e., reduce variation in acoustic features due to speaker characteristics)
and produce graphical representations of vowel data
for sociophonetic research.

Using VLNM
----------

After installing (see the section on :ref:`section_installation` for details),
|vlnm| can used in as part of any Python programme or script,
however to get get started quickly it is probably easiest
to use |jupyter| to create 'notebooks' which enable
easy editing of Python code, inspecting and manipulating
of vowel data, and the display of vowel plots.
