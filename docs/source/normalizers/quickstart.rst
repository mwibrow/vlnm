Getting started
===============

|vlnm| can be used in a terminal (called the `command prompt`
or `PowerShell` on Windows) running a Python process.
This is what starting Python in a terminal on MacOS might look like:

.. code::

    $ python
    Python 3.7.2 (default, Feb 25 2019, 09:00:08)
    [Clang 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.5)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> from vlnm import normalize
    >>>

Alternatively, |vlnm| may be used from a Jupyter notebook, in which
case starting a new notebook will automatically start Python.

.. ipython
    :code-only:

    from vlnm import normalize
