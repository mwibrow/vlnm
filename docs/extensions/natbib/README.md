# Natbib

This is an incomplete re-implementation of
[sphinx-natbib](https://bitbucket.org/wnielson/sphinx-natbib/src/bca311d89fb3f89c07ab4906b98abc187b24d882/docs/index.rst)
borrowing ideas heavily from [sphinxcontrib-bibtex](https://github.com/mcmtroffaes/sphinxcontrib-bibtex)
and [Pybtex](https://pybtex.org/).

It is *highly* opinionated (i.e., it supports one style with no customisation)
and only supports HTML output.
