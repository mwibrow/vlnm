Vowel normalization using Python.

Introduction
============

**VLNM** is a Python package, primarily aimed at phoneticians
who need to normalize vowel data
(i.e., reduce variation in acoustic features due to speaker characteristics)
for sociophonetic research.

For installation and usage,
see the `documentation <https://mwibrow.github.io/vlnm/>`_.


**VLNM** is pre-alpha.
The API is more-or-less stable and unlikely to change.
Bugs should be expected and (ideally) reported.
